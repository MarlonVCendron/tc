This study aims to develop and analyze a realistic simulation of the different phases of sleep in a Spiking Neural Network (SNN)
and their influence on the consolidation and retention of memories. The objective is to better understand the nature of learning
and memory processes in the human brain, and how these processes are affected by the different phases of sleep. To this end, the
characteristics and properties of the different phases of sleep will be investigated to provide a solid foundation for the
simulation. Then, an appropriate SNN model will be selected and used to simulate neural activity during sleep. Finally, the
results of the simulation will be analyzed to determine how consolidation and memory retention are affected by the different
phases of sleep and by neural activity during these phases. It is hoped that this research can contribute to the understanding of
the mechanisms underlying the processes of learning and memory in the human brain and may have significant implications for the
fields of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
