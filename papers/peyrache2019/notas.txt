A mechanism for learning with sleep spindles

* They occur during NREM, mainly on stage 2
* Research shows spindles are related to learnng and memory
* spindles are associated with increased dendritic activity and high intracellular calcium levels
* During spindles, thalamocortical networks become unresponsive to inputs, thus potentially preventing interference between memory-related internal information processing and extrinsic signals
* spindles are co-modulated with other major NREM oscillations, including hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) and neocortical slow waves, both previously shown to be associated with learning and memory

Sleep is considered to be an ideal brain state for reprocessing memories in order to sort, consolidate and generalize recently acquired knowledge
